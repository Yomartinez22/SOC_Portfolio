# SOC Portfolio — Blue Team from Zero[1]

Goal: Build, in 4–6 months part‑time, a junior SOC/Blue Team profile with solid fundamentals, realistic hands‑on practice, and a verifiable 6–8 piece portfolio before applying in Switzerland.[2]
Method: Follow a structured SOC Analyst Learning Path with guided modules and labs, document everything with reproducible writeups, and map coverage to MITRE ATT&CK.[3][4]

## Weekly cadence[2]
- 60–90 min theory from the active module (short notes and ATT&CK mapping).[3]
- 2–3 h hands‑on labs/challenges (phishing/web, SIEM/triage, DFIR, hunting).[5]
- 30–60 min documentation: one writeup or playbook/cheatsheet update.[1]

## Month 1 milestones[3]
- SOC fundamentals and alert flow; core ATT&CK tactics/techniques.[6]
- 2 labs: phishing analysis and web attack detection with writeups.[3]
- SIEM 101: basic queries and a triage cheatsheet.[7]
- 1 short IR playbook (detection → containment → recovery).[8]
- Initial ATT&CK layer with 10 techniques and log sources notes.[4]

## Portfolio deliverables[1]
- Writeups: 6–8 cases (phishing/web, SIEM/triage, DFIR, hunting) with reproducible steps.[5]
- IR playbook: 1–2 pages with escalation criteria and report templates.[8]
- SIEM cheatsheet: Splunk/KQL queries and common triage patterns.[9]
- Detection rules: at least 2, ATT&CK‑mapped and validated in the home lab.[4]

## Repository structure[1]
- docs/attck → ATT&CK .json layers and mapping notes.[4]
- docs/metrics.md → hours, completed labs, techniques covered.[1]
- docs/resources.md → study links and quick references.[1]
- labs/phishing-web → writeups and artifacts.[3]
- labs/siem-triage → queries, screenshots, mini‑reports.[7]
- labs/dfir-hunting → timelines, findings, detection improvements.[5]
- playbooks/ → IR playbook and report templates.[8]

## Study plan (pre‑application)[10]
- Frameworks and concepts: MITRE ATT&CK, Cyber Kill Chain, IR lifecycle, common SOC alerts.[11]
- Systems and logs: Windows (logon, process, registry, Sysmon), Linux (auth/sudo/cron), basic web logs.[7]
- SIEM: ingestion/normalization, queries, rules, prioritization, threat intel enrichment.[9]
- Common threats: phishing, initial malware, basic lateral movement, frequent persistence.[3]
- Early hunting: hypotheses, baselines, TTPs vs IoCs, documenting findings.[12]

## Platform and modules[3]
- Path: SOC Analyst Learning Path covering ATT&CK, SIEM, IR, malware, and guided labs.[6]
- Note: log weekly progress per module in docs/metrics.md.[1]

## Metrics and tracking[1]
- Planned hours/week: 4–6; actual: update every Sunday.[2]
- Labs completed this week: count and links to writeups.[5]
- New ATT&CK techniques covered: brief list with IDs.[4]

## Next steps (Week 0)[4]
- Day 1: create repo and structure, open account on the SOC path, prep an empty ATT&CK Navigator layer.[13]
- Day 2: annotate 5 frequent ATT&CK techniques with “which logs to look at.”[4]
- Day 3: draft a 1‑page triage map for common incidents.[6]

## Quick references[4]
- MITRE ATT&CK — Get Started: official fundamentals and resources.[4]
- ATT&CK Navigator — step‑by‑step layer creation and export.[13]
- SIEM — core concepts and 2025 capability checklist.[9]
- SOC interviews — checklists and preparation.[8]
